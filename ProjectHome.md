This project is an extension + windows port of the project csuFaceIdEval v.5 originally developed by Colorado State University. If you have any questions regarding the original project, please refer to following link http://www.cs.colostate.edu/evalfacerec/


The original project implements four base algorithms and infrastructure to evaluate namely

1) A standard PCA, or Eigenfaces, algorithm

2) A combination PCA and LDA algorithm based upon the University of Maryland algorithm in the FERET tests.

3) A Bayesian Intrapersonal/Extrapersonal Image Difference Classifier based upon the MIT algorithm in the FERET tests.

4) An Elastic Bunch Graph Matching Algorithm that uses localized landmark features represented by Gabor jets. This algorithm is based upon the USC algorithm in the FERET tests.

This project is created to allow people to share their contributions to this project. The first version of extension implements the algorithm,

5) Laplacianfaces face recognition algorithm. It is an implementation of "Face Recognition Using Laplacianfaces by Xiaofei He, Shuicheng Yan, Yuxiao Hu, Partha Niyogi, and Hong-Jiang Zhang, Fellow, IEEE" published in "IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE, VOL. 27, NO. 3, MARCH 2005."
